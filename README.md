# LaTeX-Vim-User-Manual
A reformating of the Vim user manual using LaTeX.
This was done by downloading the html version of the user manual, as they were the 12 July 2019, and converting these html files to tex files with `pandoc`.
The compilation was done using `pdflatex`.
There are probably some inconsistencies, feel free to report them me or to make a pull request.

## Used packages

- longtable
- etoc
- shlashbox
- fancyvrb

*NB* : The etoc package needs to be version 1.9 or higher.

## Adopted conventions
